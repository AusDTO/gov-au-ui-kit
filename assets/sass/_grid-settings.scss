Grid

This framework uses [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) to create a consistent 16 column responsive grid layout with good defaults.

Bourbon is a [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) mixin library (it provides little styling). Neat is a flexible grid framework.

Avoid mixing this layout with other grid layouts.

<p class="callout"><strong>Grid classes?</strong> There are no non-semantic grid classes with which to set block elements. This is intentional. If you need to add to or customise the grid system see below.</p>

The grid unit proportions, gutters and spacing are defined in `_grid-settings.scss`.

/*
Extending settings

If you need an element not defined here you are probably not the only one&mdash;please [log a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues) so we can provide it for everyone.

We define the grid placement for the following elements in `_block-elements.scss`:

- `header[role='banner']`
- `footer[role='contentinfo']`
- `main`
- `article`
- `aside`.

To create your own element you will need to use the [Neat `span-columns` function](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/#span-columns).

For each new element you will need to manually set column properties for the breakpoints, from smallest to largest:
1. `$mobile`
2. `$tablet`
3. `$desktop`

/*
Margins & gutters

Maximum page width is set to 1200px. Gutters between the columns are a minimum of 32px.

```
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(32);
```

Style guide: Grid.3 Margins & gutters
*/

$grid-columns: 4 !global;
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(32);


/*
Breakpoints

This framework has a mobile-first default layout of 4 columns, and adds 3 breakpoints for grid layout on larger screens:

- Default: 4 columns
- Mobile: 8 columns, 420px minimum
- Tablet: 12 columns, 768px minimum
- Desktop: 16 columns, 1200px minimum

If you give an element a modified grid setting consider the implications for all breakpoints. The Digital Service Standard recommends you [build using mobile first design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/).

Please also consider the [font size](section-typography.html#kssref-typography-2-headings-body-copy-1-breakpoints) at different breakpoints.

```
$mobile: new-breakpoint(min-width 420px 8);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(min-width 768px 12);
$desktop: new-breakpoint(min-width $max-width 16);
```

Style guide: Grid.4 Breakpoints
*/

@import 'vendor/neat/neat-helpers';
$mobile: new-breakpoint(min-width 420px 8);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(min-width 768px 12);
$desktop: new-breakpoint(min-width $max-width 16);

/*
Layout

Primary content is always contained in 12 columns. This allows for seamless introduction of a sidebar/side navigation.

*/

/*
Wrapper class

There is a wrapper class (`<div class="wrapper">`) for wrapping the contents of a block within the grid, while allowing its outer container to run the full viewport width.

This is currently used for the page `header` and `footer`, and also for the [breadcrumbs](section-navigation.html#kssref-navigation-2-breadcrumbs).

Style guide: Grid.6 Wrapper class
*/

/*
Header & footer

The site header and footer are targeted by their ARIA roles, not a `class` or `id`. Use `banner` and `contentinfo` roles, respectively.

Style guide: Grid.7 Header & footer
*/

/*
Accessibility

Long lines reduce legibility. Lines of text should be no longer than 75 characters including spaces. Place text in narrower grid boxes to stop text lines from becoming too wide.

Low-vision users should be able to increase the size of the text by up to 200 per cent without breaking the layout.

Style guide: Grid.8 Accessibility
*/

/*
Debugging

Turn on the visual grid to help debugging:

```
$visual-grid: true;
```

See the example [Bourbon Neat working grid layout](http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/).

Style guide: Grid.9 Debugging
*/

// Toggle visibility of your grid columns for development/debugging.
$visual-grid: false;

$border-box-sizing: true;
$disable-warnings: true;

// Make sure you set the viewport to the device-width in your head, eg
// <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
